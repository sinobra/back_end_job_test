This is a javascript-based temperature converter
Just run 'rails server' and type "localhost:3000" in you browser to access the program.

As to the program's extensibility:

All of the javascript code is scoped to window.CONVERTER.
All of the temperature code is scoped to window.CONVERTER.temperature.

The click-handlers on the buttons call generic handlers.  These handlers are assigned to temperature functions
in the intialize() function in convert.js.coffee.

If you wanted to add, say a miles-to-kilometers converter you could add the necessary functions in say,
window.CONVERTER.mileage.

There is space on the left to list other converter labels.  It should be simple to add the labels and re-assign the
specific converter functions to the the click-handlers when a label is clicked.

There are a set of cucumber tests that I relied on when I generalized the my first (temperature-specific) version of the
program.

From the rails directory, type: cucumber features/temp_converter.feature.
